## Introduction

Maarten Wijntjes was asked by the TU Delft Library to curate a new glass slides exhibition in the window next to the main entry. This window was originally designed as a viewing stage to take a sneak peak into the TU Delft heritage collection. As the vantage point was not very informative, the Library decided a few years ago to bring the action directly onto the window.
