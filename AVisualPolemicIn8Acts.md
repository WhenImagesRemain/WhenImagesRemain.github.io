## Introduction

We were asked by the TU Delft Library to curate a new glass slides exhibition in the window next to the main entry. This window was originally designed as a viewing stage to take a sneak peak into the TU Delft heritage collection. As the vantage point was not very informative, the Library decided a few years ago to bring the action directly onto the window.

We found an archive of magic lantern slides that had been used in art education, likely at the department of Architecture during the 1920's. A century later, we are still/again using art images in education, but now in a course at Industrial Design Engineering, so that was the first step towards the final work.

Exposing magic lantern slides of artworks is inherently weird: the slides are tiny and meant to be _projected_, and the monochrome photos are no match to contemporary art reproductions (both digital and in print). The 'only' upside is their material connection to the past. Therefore, our first decision was to materialise our own art images collection and mix it with the historical collection.

If you put two images next to each other, you not only show two pictures, but you also suggest a relation. That is the eternal challenge of any curator creating a collection or exhibition. Our second decision was to hallucinate explicit connections with generative AI. We started with some prototypes:
